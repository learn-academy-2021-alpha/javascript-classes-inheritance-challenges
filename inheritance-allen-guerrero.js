// Challenge 1
// Story: As a programmer, I can make a car.

// Create a class called 'Car'
class Car {
    constructor() {
        // As a programmer, I can give my car a model on initialization.
        // The model for the car class can be "generic car"
        this.model = 'generic car';
    }
}

// Create variable that stores the object 'myCar', which is an instance of the class Car
var myCar = new Car();

console.log(myCar);
